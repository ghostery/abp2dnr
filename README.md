# abp2dnr

This is a script to convert [Adblock Plus filter lists](https://adblockplus.org/filters)
to [chrome.declarativeNetRequest rulesets](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declarativeNetRequest)
as far as is possible.

See also [Chromium's built-in filter list converter](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:extensions/browser/api/declarative_net_request/filter_list_converter/).

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure to install [Node.js](2) (version 16 or higher) and
[whatever node-gyp requires](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-unix) to
compile RE2 on your system.

Then the required packages can be installed via Git and [npm](https://npmjs.org):

    git submodule update --init
    npm install

The declarativeNetRequest rulesets generated by this script require
Chrome >= 101 to function correctly.
([See this announcement for context](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/4971ZS9cI7E).)

## Usage

### Command line interface

Create a `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` rule list `output.json` from the
Adblock Plus filter list `input.txt`:

    node abp2dnr.js < input.txt > output.json

#### API

Behind that, there's an API which the command line interface uses. It works
something like this:

    const {convertFilter} = require("./lib/abp2dnr");

    let nextId = 1;
    let rules = [];

    for (let filter in filters)
    {
      for (let rule of await convertFilter(filter))
      {
        rule.id = nextId++;
        rules.push(rule);
      }
    }

It's important to note that `convertFilter` expects a `Filter` Object and _not_
a string containing the filter's text. To parse filter text you'll need to
do something like this first:

    const {Filter} = require("adblockpluscore/lib/filterClasses");
    Filter.fromText(Filter.normalize(filterText));

## Tests

Unit tests live in the `tests/` directory. You can run them by typing this command:

    npm test

## Linting
